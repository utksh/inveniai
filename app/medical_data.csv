4,"Catheterization laboratory events and hospital outcome with direct angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction To assess the safety of direct infarct angioplasty without antecedent thrombolytic therapy, catheterization laboratory and hospital events were assessed in consecutively treated patients with infarctions involving the left anterior descending (n = 100 patients), right (n = 100), and circumflex (n = 50) coronary arteries. The groups of patients were similar for age (left anterior descending coronary artery, 59 years; right coronary artery, 58 years; circumflex coronary artery, 62 years), patients with multivessel disease (left anterior descending coronary artery, 55%; right coronary artery, 55%; circumflex coronary artery, 64%), and patients with initial grade 0/1 antegrade flow (left anterior descending coronary artery, 79%; right coronary artery, 84%; circumflex coronary artery, 90%). Cardiogenic shock was present in eight patients with infarction of the left anterior descending coronary artery, four with infarction of the right coronary artery, and four with infarction of the circumflex coronary artery. Major catheterization laboratory events (cardioversion, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, dopamine or intra-aortic balloon pump support for hypotension, and urgent surgery) occurred in 10 patients with infarction of the left anterior descending coronary artery, eight with infarction of the right coronary artery, and four with infarction of the circumflex coronary artery (16 of 16 shock and six of 234 nonshock patients, p less than 0.001). There was one in-laboratory death (shock patient with infarction of the left anterior descending coronary artery)."
5,"Renal abscess in children. Three cases of renal abscesses in children are described to illustrate the variable presenting features. An additional 23 pediatric cases, reported over the past ten years, were reviewed for clinical features and therapy. Fever, loin pain, and leukocytosis were common presenting features, but less than half of all abscesses were associated with either an abnormal urinalysis or a positive urine culture. The presenting features were sometimes confused with appendicitis, peritonitis, or a Wilms tumor. An organism was identified in 17 cases--Escherichia coli in 9 children and Staphylococcus aureus in 8 children. The majority of E. coli infections occurred in girls and the majority of S. aureus infections occurred in boys. Reflux was documented in 5 patients, and 2 children had a possible extrarenal source of infection. Antibiotics alone produced a cure in 10 children (38%), but 16 children (62%) required a surgical procedure."
2,"Hyperplastic polyps seen at sigmoidoscopy are markers for additional adenomas seen at colonoscopy. Asymptomatic individuals undergoing screening flexible sigmoidoscopy were prospectively studied. Polyps were found in 185 subjects. The endoscopist recorded an opinion on the polyps' histology based on endoscopic appearance. No polyps were removed at sigmoidoscopy. All subjects with rectosigmoid polyps then underwent colonoscopy and polypectomy. Of them, 99 subjects (54%) had at least one rectosigmoid adenoma, 69 (37%) had only hyperplastic polyps, and 17 (9%) had other findings. The endoscopists' opinion of the histopathology of polyps at sigmoidoscopy was correct for 61% of the lesions. Of subjects with adenomatous rectosigmoid polyps, 29% had additional adenomas at more proximal sites. Proximal adenomas were found in 28% of patients with hyperplastic rectosigmoid polyps. Patients with rectosigmoid hyperplastic polyps had the same risk for additional proximal adenomas as patients with rectosigmoid adenomatous polyps."
5,"Subclavian artery to innominate vein fistula after insertion of a hemodialysis catheter. Insertion of hemodialysis catheters for temporary use is now preferentially performed by percutaneous infraclavicular subclavian vein catheterization. This method involves passage of a stiff dilator and a peel-away sheath over a guide wire, and is usually carried out without fluoroscopy. For the most part this has proved to be a valuable and safe approach. However, a small incidence of major complications occurs, which needs to be emphasized. Sixteen cases of arteriovenous fistulas between the subclavian artery or its branches and the subclavian vein have been reported so far in the literature. To date only one case of subclavian artery to innominate vein fistula has been reported. We report the second case with this complication and suggest possible preventive measures."
4,"Effect of local inhibition of gamma-aminobutyric acid uptake in the dorsomedial hypothalamus on extracellular levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid and on stress-induced tachycardia: a study using microdialysis. Previous studies involving local microinjection of drugs that interfere with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor-mediated synaptic inhibition have led to the suggestion that endogenous GABA suppresses the activity of a sympatho-excitatory mechanism in the dorsomedial hypothalamus in rats. In this study, microdialysis was used to assess and to alter pharmacologically extracellular-levels of GABA within this region while simultaneously monitoring heart rate and blood pressure. In anesthetized rats, local microdialysis for 15 min with 2.5, 10 and 40 mM nipecotic acid, an inhibitor of GABA uptake, caused concentration-related increases in GABA and taurine in the extracellular space, but no significant change in heart rate or arterial pressure. Similar perfusion with 37.5, 75 and 150 mM KCl caused concentration-related increases in GABA as well as aspartate, glutamate, taurine, glycine and alanine. Only modest, variable increases in heart rate and no effect on arterial pressure were observed during the perfusions with high potassium. In conscious rats, unilateral microdialysis of the dorsomedial hypothalamus with 0.5 mM nipecotic acid for 2 to 2.5 hr before stress coupled with contralateral microinjection of muscimol (88 pmol/250 nl) 5 min before stress significantly reduced air stress-induced tachycardia; this reduction in tachycardia was associated with markedly elevated levels of GABA in dialysates collected from the dorsomedial hypothalamus. Neither treatment alone significantly influenced stress-induced increases in heart rate, although perfusion with nipecotic acid alone evoked similar elevations in extracellular GABA. These results suggest that extracellular levels of endogenous GABA in the dorsomedial hypothalamus may regulate the cardiovascular response to stress."
1,"Infection during chronic epidural catheterization: diagnosis and treatment. A potentially serious complication of long-term epidural catheterization in cancer patients is infection. The early signs of infection were studied in 350 patients in whom long-term epidural catheters were inserted. Three areas of the catheter track were found to be involved; exit site and superficial catheter track infection, and epidural space infection. The authors identified the early signs of infection in each area and the progress of the infection from the deep track to include the epidural space in four of these patients. All 19 patients who developed deep track or epidural infections were successfully treated with antibiotics and catheter removal. None of the patients required surgery for spinal cord decompression. Catheters were replaced in 15 of the 19 treated patients who requested them after treatment with no recurrent infections. It was concluded that use of long-term epidural catheterization is associated with a definable epidural infection rate. The use of epidural opioid analgesia is an effective and safe means of obtaining pain relief for terminally ill patients when patients are monitored for possible infection and receive prompt treatment when the diagnosis is established."
5,"Mediastinal tracheostomy using a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap after resection of carcinoma of the esophagus involving the proximal part of the trachea. An operative procedure of mediastinal tracheostomy using a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap is presented. In this procedure, the terminal portion of the trachea penetrates through the center of a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap and the tracheal wall is completely wrapped with the muscular portion of the flap. Between 1981 and 1988, eight patients with carcinoma in the cervicothoracic segment of the esophagus underwent mediastinal tracheostomy after laryngoesophagectomy and extended resection of the proximal part of the trachea through sternal manubrectomy, because of invasion into the trachea. In five of eight patients, a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap was used to construct a tracheal stoma. A skin flap only, or both a skin flap and a muscle flap, was used in the other three. In four of eight patients, tracheal necrosis occurred, and rupture of the brachiocephalic artery occurred in one patient when the tracheal stoma had been constructed using both a skin flap and a muscle flap. However, neither skin breakdown nor bleeding from the major vessels occurred when using the myocutaneous flap. Therefore, it is concluded that the construction of the tracheal stoma using a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap is recommended for mediastinal tracheostomy after laryngoesophagectomy with extended resection of the proximal part of the trachea."
5,"Tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesion of the extremity. Report of a case and review of the literature. Tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesion is an idiopathic fibroinflammatory process of the head and neck region. Although benign histopathologically, it is invasive, destructive, and locally recurrent, leading to uncertainty regarding its proper management; as the disease is rare, determining optimal treatment is difficult, given the anecdotal nature of reports. We report the first case of a tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesion occurring outside the head and neck region. Our patient was treated with corticosteroids and had a favorable response, supporting this approach as initial treatment. Immunohistochemical studies performed on a pretreatment specimen were consistent with a secondary inflammatory component because no monoclonal nor aberrant phenotypes were detected. The tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesion appears to be indistinguishable from the other known idiopathic fibroinflammatory processes; patients presenting with any one of these should be evaluated for the others."
3,"Multiple representations contribute to body knowledge processing. Evidence from a case of autotopagnosia. Body schema disturbances were studied in a 62-yr-old woman with Alzheimer's disease. She was severely impaired in verbal and nonverbal tasks requiring her to localize body parts (on her own body, the examiner's body or a doll's body) even though she correctly named the same parts when pointed at by the examiner. Pointing responses were misdirected mainly to parts contiguous with the target area and, to a lesser extent, to functionally equivalent body parts. We also found that the patient was able to define body part names functionally but not spatially. In another series of tasks, and in contrast to the above results, performances were normal when small objects, attached to the patient's body, served as pointing targets. Furthermore, on subsequent testing she pointed correctly at the remembered position of these objects. The fact that the same point in 'body space' is localized correctly when it corresponds to an external object and erroneously when it corresponds to a body part contradicts the idea of the body schema as a unitary function. Learning the position of objects on the body surface requires access to some form of body-reference system on which this information can be mapped. We argue that such a system can be available in autotopagnosia and is independent from the visuospatial representations of the body structure that are postulated to be damaged or inaccessible in this syndrome. An integrated account of the present results and of those reported by other authors suggests that multiple levels of representation (e.g., sensorimotor, visuospatial, semantic) are involved in the organization of body knowledge."
5,"Increasing asthma prevalence in a rural New Zealand adolescent population: 1975-89. A survey of asthma symptoms and spirometry in 435 adolescent schoolchildren was undertaken in 1989 in a rural, largely Maori population. The survey questionnaires were identical to those used in a 1975 survey at the same school. The prevalence of reported asthma or wheeze significantly increased from 26.2% to 34.0%. This increase occurred in groups reporting asthma, and also those reporting wheeze unassociated with colds, but without a previous diagnosis of asthma. There was a tendency for a rise in reported wheeze in Europeans (24.3% to 27.4%) and a significant rise in Maoris (27.1% to 36.2%). The reclassification of other respiratory problems did not account for the increase. Data from this study provides evidence that there has been a rise in the prevalence of asthma in this New Zealand population over a time period of 14 years."
5,"Usefulness of the automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator in improving survival of patients with severely depressed left ventricular function associated with coronary artery disease. Clinical outcome was analyzed among a group of 39 consecutive patients with coronary artery disease, left ventricular (LV) ejection fractions less than 30% and arrhythmias that required an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) in an attempt to better define the role of the device in patients with severely depressed LV function. Twenty-nine (74%) were survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and 10 (26%) had ventricular tachycardia that was refractory to electrophysiologically guided antiarrhythmic therapy. The study group had the following demographic characteristics: 90% were men, mean age was 64 years (range 41 to 79) and mean LV ejection fraction was 21 +/- 4%. Concomitant pharmacotherapy included antiarrhythmic drugs 31 (79%), vasodilators in 22 (56%) and digoxin in 20 (51%). There was no statistical difference in baseline characteristics between survivors and nonsurvivors. Patients were followed for a mean of 24 months (range 2 to 72) from implantation. The difference between actuarial survival--77% at 1 year and 72% at 2 years--and projected survival without the AICD (patients who survive without appropriate device discharge)--30% at 1 year and 21% at 2 years--was significant (p less than 0.01 and less than 0.05 at 1 and 2 years, respectively). This study suggests that the AICD improves survival in patients with coronary artery disease despite severely depressed LV function."
5,"Stress-related mucosal damage: review of drug therapy. The increased awareness of stress-related mucosal damage (SRMD) that accompanied the widespread use of fiberoptic endoscopy and the increased incidence of SRMD that accompanied the advances in caring for critically ill patients resulted in the recognition that the majority of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting wil develop mucosal damage. Complications of gastrointestinal hemorrhage in these patients may contribute significantly to their morbidity and mortality, and the consequences of this bleeding may be more severe than the underlying predisposing conditions. Because of the importance of gastric acid in the pathogenesis of SRMD, therapy has focused on reduction of the intraluminal acid concentration. Acid neutralization, while effective, is laborious and associated with side effects. H2-receptor antagonists have been used successfully in the prophylaxis and treatment of SRMD and offer the potential for an effective parenteral as well as oral agent. They obviate the need for frequent antacid administration and eliminate some of the troubles and side effects that accompany an intensive antacid regimen. Of the available H2-receptor antagonists, cimetidine has been the most thoroughly evaluated. It is equivalent to antacids in the prevention of overt bleeding and offers the advantage of dosing flexibility, ease of administration, and a remarkable safety profile. Cimetidine has also been shown to be effective when administered by intermittent bolus infusions given every 8, 6, or 4 h or by primed continuous infusion, which has proven to be the most successful method of controlling intragastric pH."
2,"A biphasic pattern of anti-pre-S responses in acute hepatitis B virus infection. The clinical relevance of the immune response to the translation products of the pre-S1 and pre-S2 regions of hepatitis B virus was examined by testing sequential serum samples from 17 patients with acute self-limited hepatitis B and from two patients in whom chronic liver disease developed. Anti-pre-S antibodies were determined by enzyme immunoassays based on the inhibition of binding of monoclonal antibodies to epitopes in the pre-S1 and pre-S2 sequence. In acute, self-limited infection, anti-pre-S antibodies appeared in a biphasic pattern. The early antibodies were detected at the time of clinical signs of acute disease when HBsAg and often HBeAg were present, but hepatitis B virus DNA was no longer detectable in serum. Anti-pre-S levels then fell, but subsequently reappeared as the late antibody during the recovery phase, after development of anti-HBe, but before anti-HBs. Anti-pre-S responses were detected in 15 of 17 patients who recovered (88.2%) and in both patients with acute hepatitis B virus infection evolving to chronic liver disease. Although the early antibodies to pre-S1 and pre-S2 proteins appeared at the time of decreasing levels of infectious virus in serum in cases of self-limited infection, these antibodies also were transiently or continuously present with high levels of serum hepatitis B virus DNA in patients in whom chronic hepatitis B infection developed. Thus the anti-pre-S response in acute hepatitis is not a prognostic marker for clinical resolution."
5,"A controlled trial comparing vidarabine with acyclovir in neonatal herpes simplex virus infection. Infectious Diseases Collaborative Antiviral Study Group. BACKGROUND. Despite the use of vidarabine, herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection in neonates continues to be a disease of high morbidity and mortality. We undertook a controlled trial comparing vidarabine with acyclovir for the treatment of neonatal HSV infection. METHODS. Babies less than one month of age with virologically confirmed HSV infection were randomly and blindly assigned to receive either intravenous vidarabine (30 mg per kilogram of body weight per day; n = 95) or acyclovir (30 mg per kilogram per day; n = 107) for 10 days. Actuarial rates of mortality and morbidity among the survivors after one year were compared overall and according to the extent of the disease at entry into the study (infection confined to the skin, eyes, or mouth; encephalitis; or disseminated disease). RESULTS. After adjustment for differences between groups in the extent of disease, there was no difference between vidarabine and acyclovir in either morbidity (P = 0.83) or mortality (P = 0.27). None of the 85 babies with disease confined to the skin, eyes, or mouth died. Of the 31 babies in this group who were treated with vidarabine and followed for a year, 88 percent (22 of 25) were judged to be developing normally after one year, as compared with 98 percent (45 of 46) of the 54 treated with acyclovir (95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -4 to 24). For the 71 babies with encephalitis, mortality was 14 percent with vidarabine (5 of 36) and with acyclovir (5 of 35); of the survivors, 43 percent (13 of 30) and 29 percent (8 of 28), respectively, were developing normally after one year (95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -11 to 39). For the 46 babies with disseminated disease, mortality was 50 percent (14 of 28) with vidarabine and 61 percent (11 of 18) with acyclovir (95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -20 to 40); of the survivors, 58 percent (7 of 12) and 60 percent (3 of 5), respectively, were judged to be developing normally after one year (95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -40 to 50). Both medications were without serious toxic effects. CONCLUSIONS. In this multicenter, randomized, blinded study there were no differences in outcome between vidarabine and acyclovir in the treatment of neonatal HSV infection. The study lacked statistical power to determine whether there were sizable differences within the subgroups of those with localized HSV, encephalitis, or disseminated disease."
5,"Pentostatin induces durable remissions in hairy cell leukemia. Fifty patients with hairy cell leukemia were treated with pentostatin (2'-deoxycoformycin; dCF) for a median of 3 months; 32 (64%) patients achieved complete remission (CR), and 10 (20%) patients achieved partial remission (PR), for an overall response rate of 84%. After reaching maximal response, no maintenance therapy was administered. The median duration of follow-up is now 39 months, and only four of 32 patients in CR and two of 10 patients in PR have relapsed. dCF therapy produces durable long-term, disease-free survival in patients with hairy cell leukemia."
5,"Cytologic features of poorly differentiated 'insular' carcinoma of the thyroid, as revealed by fine-needle aspiration biopsy. The authors report on the cytologic features of six cases of poorly differentiated ""insular"" carcinoma (IC) of the thyroid, a recently described variety of thyroid tumor intermediate between well-differentiated and anaplastic neoplasms. It is characterized by trabecular and/or alveolar growth patterns, merging with follicular areas, and by the absence of pleomorphism in the tumor cells. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) materials (both smears and cell-block preparations) from six patients were reviewed after the diagnosis of IC was confirmed on the surgical specimen. The following cytologic features were consistently found: high cellularity and necrotic background; low grade of atypia; trabeculae and/or clusters, possibly associated with microfollicles, of cells with poorly defined cytoplasm; and cytoplasmic vacuoles containing thyroglobulin. Nuclear inclusions and grooving of the nuclear surface were additional features. Preoperative diagnosis suggestive of IC might be of value for planning surgical treatment and subsequent therapy."
1,"Cutaneous manifestations of multiple myeloma. We report the cutaneous manifestations of multiple myeloma, using a retrospective review of 115 patients' records obtained from tumor registry files. Five patients were found to have biopsy-proved extramedullary plasmacytomas without extension from an underlying bony focus. Twelve patients had ecchymoses without thrombocytopenia; two of them had biopsy-proved amyloidosis. One patient presented with pyoderma gangrenosum and was subsequently diagnosed with multiple myeloma. The last patient initially presented with what clinically appeared to be leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and, in the course of a standard workup, he was diagnosed with multiple myeloma. These findings are discussed with regard to the current literature on the cutaneous manifestations of multiple myeloma."
5,"Steal-prone coronary anatomy and myocardial ischemia associated with four primary anesthetic agents in humans. To examine the relationship between myocardial ischemia in patients with steal-prone coronary anatomy and the administration of isoflurane anesthesia, we reviewed coronary angiograms of 955 patients who had participated in a randomized trial of the use of one of four primary anesthetics for coronary artery bypass operations. Steal-prone anatomy was found in 31.8% of patients who had received enflurane; 40.0%, halothane; 32.6%, isoflurane; and 31.7%, sufentanil. Detected by greater than or equal to 0.1 mV ST segment displacement, ischemia during anesthesia occurred in 290 (30.4%) of all patients with no difference in the incidence among the four primary anesthetics (27.5%-32.9%). Patients with steal-prone anatomy did not suffer more ischemia than patients who needed coronary artery bypass surgery but with other varieties of coronary anatomy. In patients with steal-prone coronary anatomy, the incidence of myocardial ischemia by primary anesthetic was 24.0% with enflurane, 34.4% with halothane, 32.1% with isoflurane, and 38.2% with sufentanil. Systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg during anesthesia occurred in 416 (45.6%) patients and was twice as common during administration of volatile anesthetics than during that of sufentanil. Hypotension did not increase ischemia frequency in patients with steal-prone anatomy with use of any of the four primary anesthetics including isoflurane. Ischemia was temporally related to hypotension in only 9 patients (0.9%). In none of the 42 patients who had steal-prone anatomy and hypotension during isoflurane anesthesia was ischemia temporally related to hypotension."
